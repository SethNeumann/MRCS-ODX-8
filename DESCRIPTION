High Density Expandable cpOD-M motherboard.  Jon Robinson requested a larger motherboard
comparable to Dr. Chubb's ODMB. The pbject is to get as many cpOD-Ms as possible into a 7
x 15 CM board and provide connectors for expansion. He also requested keeping the logic 
level outputs away from the block power outputs.  The board will be expandable via an end
connector.  More than two are not recommended as the copper is only good for about 5 Amps.
