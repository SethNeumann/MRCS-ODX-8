High Density Expandable cpOD-M motherboard.  Jon Robinson requested a larger motherboard
comparable to Dr. Chubb's ODMB. The plan is to get as many cpOD-Ms as possible into a 7
x 15 CM board and provide connectors for expansion. He also requested keeping the logic 
level outputs away from the block power outputs.  The board will be expandable via an end
connector.  More than two are not recommended as the copper is only good for about 5 Amps.

Use this space (in Markdown format) to describe the context and details of the changes.
This section should be 5 to 20 lines of interesting detail; each version tab in the project will 
display this text to help the reader understand why this version is differnet...

The published project on the SPCoast.github.io website will
include the relevant git commit messages as a terse, high level
changelog, so don't replicate those messages here.
