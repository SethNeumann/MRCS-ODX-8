High Density Expandable cpOD-M motherboard.  Jon Robinson requested a larger motherboard
comparable to Dr. Chubb's ODMB. The plan is to get as many cpOD-Ms as possible into a 7
x 15 CM board and provide connectors for expansion. He also requested keeping the logic 
level outputs away from the block power outputs.  The board will be expandable via an end
connector.  More than two are not recommended as the copper is only good for about 5 Amps.

ODX-8 are backward compatible with current cpOD-Ms, but mechanically will not fit DCC-ODs.
No software changes are needed.

- Board size 2.7" x 5.8" (69x150 mm)

- DCC Bus connections are 5 mm screw terminal blocks or 0.156 connector for expansion

- power, Ground, and Detector output connections are on a 10-position .100 (2.54 mm) screw terminal block.

The ODX-8 provides an economical and convenient mounting for up to eight cpOD-M detectors 

The ODX-8 mounts in our DIN-Rail snap track.
